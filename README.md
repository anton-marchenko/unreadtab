# unreadtab
Chrome extension that flags unvisited/unread (opened in the background) tabs, so it is easy to recognise what tabs still need to be read. Based on the original Unread Tab (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unread-tab/ofblopofekndelpkceaodkjcnfacmcfp) 1.3 by Adam Grodzki and inspired by Anton Marchenko's needs. ðŸ˜‰
